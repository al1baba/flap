## Philosophy

- Code is organic, and changes frequently, so as a team we should be aligned on how it grows, and is maintained. The base architecture should be built keeping [SOLID](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/conceptual-articles/s-o-l-i-d-the-first-five-principles-of-object-oriented-design) in mind. Allowing for flexibility when needed, but also dependable. It should be easy for newer people to ramp up, because no one likes to spend a month just to start contributing. Everyone has ownership of the codebase. Take a look [here](https://www.tatvasoft.com/outsourcing/2022/05/software-development-principles.html) for more direction!
- All ideas are welcomed, and no one person should override the consensus. Change is inevitable, so be flexible to change! Make sure to keep constant communication with your teammates, and any large sweeping changes should have an RFC in Confluence
